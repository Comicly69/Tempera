#Tempera

This is my second client I have made, I will be mostly discontinuing Amethystclient and moving on to this.
I have decided to discontinue amethyst as it never really worked and it was just a hobby project to learn how to code, I am still learning but have some basic details down and I think I am ready to move on to this. I might still be making some commits to amethyst just to try some stuff out but mostly they wont work.

I am making this client so I have a client base I can use to make bypasses and test them.
